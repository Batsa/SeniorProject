# Karmecca CRM (CSC 191, Team U-Can)

Hello and welcome to the Karmecca CRM, created by Team U-Can from California State University, Sacramento.

## Background Info

The purpose of this project was to gain hands-on experience on what it is like to work with an actual client that needs a piece of software to be made for them. In our case, we had to create what is called a CRM, or Customer Relationship Model. Karmecca, a car show company in Sacramento, California needed a way to organize and secure data from applicants wanting to participate in the car shows/conventions, and so our job was to create this CRM in order to accomplish that.

Our plans for this project circulated around the ideology of the MEAN stack, which essentially means that we used MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and NodeJS in order to build our web application. As some people may know, developing with the MEAN stack can have a decent learning curve to it, and since none of us in the team have really developed anything in general, that learning curve is emphasized further. Unfortunately, it did not come to bite us in the neck until much further down the line when we were already waist-deep into the project, and so we just had to make do with what we already had and learn what we needed to learn in order to complete the project. In hindsight, utilizing the MERN stack may have had less of a toll on us as it is known that ReactJS (the R in MERN) is much easier to work with than AngularJS (the A in MEAN). 

It should also be noted that this project is simply a "proof of concept". As we had limited time during the semester, we could not possibly dedicate our entire schedules to working on such a big project like this. As such, we were only able to accomplish the minimal amount of requirements needed in order to fulfill our client's expectations. Much of the functionality is limited because of the fact that we did not have access to our client's database due to security reasons as well as the fact that, as mentioned before, we had limited time during the semester and this project being a "proof of concept" because of that.

## Components of the Application
There are several components that go into the making of our CRM, although every one of them is not really that complicated. We have the following pieces:

- Login page
- Home page
- Graph showing current applications approved, denied, or in progress
- About us page
- Applications page

Much of the documentation regarding our application can be found in the pdf files within the documentation directory of the  repository.

## Lessons Learned as a Team

Our journey in creating a piece of software for a real client was not a smooth one, to say the least. For starters, no one in the team was really familiar with tools like Git and using it through the command line or even GitLab itself (yes, this project was originally on GitLab, importing this project over here to GitHub is another story on its own...), so we all had to do a lot of research in the first half of the semester just trying to figure out how to get everything working.

A general tl;dr list of what we have learned is as follows (in no particular order):

- Make sure enough research is done in order to figure out how much work is needed to be done to reach a particular goal
- Learning how GitLab works
- Learning different Git commands
- Resolving Merge Conflicts
- Learning what MEAN stack development means, as well as getting our feet wet with the languages involved in the MEAN stack

## Conclusion

Much of this project was a huge learning experience for us. We hope that this project demonstrates the experience and hardships that we had to endure in the making of this CRM.

# Karmecca CRM (CSC 191, Team U-Can)

Hello and welcome to the Karmecca CRM, created by Team U-Can from California State University, Sacramento.

## Background Info

The purpose of this project was to gain hands-on experience on what it is like to work with an actual client that needs a piece of software to be made for them. In our case, we had to create what is called a CRM, or Customer Relationship Model. Karmecca, a car show company in Sacramento, California needed a way to organize and secure data from applicants wanting to participate in the car shows/conventions, and so our job was to create this CRM in order to accomplish that.

Our plans for this project circulated around the ideology of the MEAN stack, which essentially means that we used MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and NodeJS in order to build our web application. As some people may know, developing with the MEAN stack can have a decent learning curve to it, and since none of us in the team have really developed anything in general, that learning curve is emphasized further. Unfortunately, it did not come to bite us in the neck until much further down the line when we were already waist-deep into the project, and so we just had to make do with what we already had and learn what we needed to learn in order to complete the project. 

## Breakdown of the Application
In progress.

## Lessons Learned as a Team

Our journey in creating a piece of software for a real client was not a smooth one, to say the least. For starters, no one in the team was really familiar with tools like Git and using it through the command line or even GitLab itself (yes, this project was originally on GitLab, importing this project over here to GitHub is another story on its own...), so we all had to do a lot of research in the first half of the semester just trying to figure out how to get everything working.

A general tl;dr list of what we have learned is as follows (in no particular order):

- Make sure enough research is done in order to figure out how much work is needed to be done to reach a particular goal
- Learning how GitLab works
- Learning different Git commands
- Resolving Merge Conflicts
- Learning what MEAN stack development means, as well as getting our feet wet with the languages involved in the MEAN stack
